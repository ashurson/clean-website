Draft#1 : I only did the html skeleton and some css to see how it'll look like.
Draft#2 : Actually finished the design this time, not completely but everything is where it needs to be(9:52).My laptop is lagging, am gonna commit this draft then restart it (Yeah,I might also use this as an excuse to procrastinate)(9:58)
Draft#3 : Aight, this commit is UGLY but at least I learned Gradients and Shadows...
Draft#4 : This draft is by far the best looking, I am gonna settle on this one, it could defiitly be better but for the sake of continuation I am gonna stop here for now and call it "consumer_ready"
